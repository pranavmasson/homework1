What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge combines the changes from one branch into another, creating a new merge commit, while a rebase moves the entire branch to a different base commit, resulting in a linear commit history without merge commits.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a version control repository hosted on a remote server, often used for collaboration and sharing code among multiple developers.
